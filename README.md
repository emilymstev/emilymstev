## 🚀 About Me

As an Independent Frontend Developer, I design and implement responsive web apps, focusing on client collaboration and real-world domain challenges.

Previously an Engineering Intern at NaviStone, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to build secure, intuitive applications using Vue.js, Nuxt UI, and Tailwind CSS. I also supported backend development following secure coding practices in an Agile environment.
